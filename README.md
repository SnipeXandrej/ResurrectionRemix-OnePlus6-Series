# Unofficial Resurrection Remix Builds for the OnePlus 6 Series devices
  Basically the official Resurrection Remix ROM for OnePlus 6/6T devices is abandoned so I wanted to build the newest RR from the official repo.
  No modifications have been done to the source code. This is basically just downloaded and compiled right after.

If you want Google Apps (GApps) you can download the NANO variant from here https://opengapps.org/

Flashing steps
- Flash OxygenOS 10 to both slots
- Boot to recovery
- Flash BUILD.zip
- Flash TWRP.zip
- Reboot to recovery
- Flash gapps.zip (optional)
- Flash Magisk.zip (optional)
- Wipe Cache
- Format data
- Reboot to system & Enjoy

NOTE:
OnePlus 6 is codenamed "Enchilada" and OnePlus 6T is codenamed "Fajita"
